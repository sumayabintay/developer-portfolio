            <h3>Have no fear Computer Science Engineer is here</h3>


            <p>Assalamualaikum, my name is Sumaya Bintay Ishak and I'm from Pabna, Bangladesh. I'm a 24 year young tech
                enthusiast who recently graduated from Green university of Bangladesh with a Computer Science &
                Engineering.
                During my studies, I developed a strong interest in software development and technology & have always
                been
                motivated by the idea of making life easier by solving technological challenges. This is something I'm
                looking
                forward to doing that as a career. I'm also a quick learner and I'm confident I can learn any new
                technology or
                development tool with ease. Additionally, my experience with product management and team collaboration
                have
                helped me develop a good understanding of the technical and design challenges involved in software
                development.
                I'm looking forward to contribute to the growth of the company and working with you. Thank you for this
                opportunity.</p>
